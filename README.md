# project_qm
the porpose of the project is to simulate and understand the collective behaviour of SuperRadiant system.

## Theoretical overwiew:
This pdf file is a short summery of the master equation approch [pdf file](./How_simple_SR_f.pdf)

There is also a powerPoint file that focuses mainly on interesting simulation results [powerPoint file](./SR_system_evolution_presentation.pptx)

## Simulation and code overwiew:
Under [sims_and_code_directory](./sr_simulation) you can locate the code used for this project.
there are two types of simulatoins
#### 1. exact simulatoin [file](./sr_simulation/exact_simulatoin_with_julia.ipynb):
  simulation of the atomic system using density metrix and 'schrodinger-equation'
#### 2. master equation simulatoin [file](./sr_simulation/SR_simulations_master_equations):
  simulation of the atomic system using density metrix and 'schrodinger-equation'
